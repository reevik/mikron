How to contribute?
===

You're welcome to contribute to the project. Please create a ticket first before you open a new pull request,
describing the issue, bug, etc. If you need a new feature, let's discuss first on [Discussions](https://github.com/reevik/mikron/discussions) if it is a good fit for the project. 

I am using [Google code style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml) in Mikron. Please make sure that your IDE is properly set up before opening a PR.

Last but not least, the Mikron is F/OSS project with the Apache 2.0 license.
